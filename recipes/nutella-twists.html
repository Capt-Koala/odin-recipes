                    These Nutella twists are such an easy way to impress. They come together with only 3 ingredients in only 30 minutes. The crispy golden puffs are the perfect size treat. Puff pastry always feels impressive, and that chocolate hazelnut is such a decadent flavor for the holidays.

                    Ingredients:
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 (17. 3 ounce) box prepared puff pastry</li>
                    <li>1 cup chocolate hazelnut spread, such as NutellaÂ®</li>
                    <li>1 large egg</li>
                </ul>
                <div></div>
                <h3>
                    Steps:
                </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment. </li>
                    <li>Lightly flour a work surface, and roll 1 puff pastry sheet out into a 10x10-inch square; set aside. Repeat with the second pastry sheet. </li>
                    <li>Spread chocolate hazelnut spread evenly across 1 puff pastry sheet. Carefully lay the second puff pastry sheet directly over top. Trim any uneven edges. Cut the pastry into 10 long 1-inch wide strips using a sharp knife or pizza cutter.  </li>
                    <li>Working with 1 strip at a time, twist each strip of pastry until the strip is twisted along the entire length. Starting at one end, coil strip into a round, tucking the end underneath. Gently set onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining strips. </li>
                    <li>Beat egg in a small bowl with a fork. Brush tops of twists with egg wash using a pastry brush.  </li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack.</li>
                </ol>
